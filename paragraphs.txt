Deficit owls flew and the ghost of Alexis de Tocqueville was invoked at The Atlantic's Economy Summit this week. The topic at hand: The debt in all its reified forms, ranging from public to private, mortgage to student, near- to long-term, and more.

An impressive roster of Washington's elites gathered to discuss the role of debt in the U.S. economy, including Obama adviser Gene Sperling, former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, New York Times Washington Bureau Chief David Leonhardt, former CBO director Alice Rivlin (crowned by Atlantic Washington Editor-at-Large Steve Clemons as "the economy's national treasure"), and former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.

But while the terms they used often sounded safe and unobjectionable - who could be against the concept of "balance"? or "de-leveraging"? or "long-term investments"? -- these safe-sounding words disguised deep differences among the speakers.
